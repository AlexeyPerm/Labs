Declares objects 
that control reading afrom and writing
to the standard streams. This include is often the 
only header you need to do input and output from a C++ p
rogram.SyntaxOnce you do certain operations on a stream, 
such as the standard input, you can't do operations of a different orien
tation on the same stream. Therefore, a program can't 
operate interchangeably on both cin and wcin, for example.
All the objects declared in this header share a peculiar 
property you can assume the
y're constructed before any static objects you define, in a trnslati
on unit that includes <iostream>. Equally, you can
 assume that these objects aren't destroyed before the 
 destructors 
for any such static objects you 
define. (The outut streams are, however, flus
hed during program termination.)
 Therefore, you can safely read from or write to 
the standard streams before program startup and after 
program termination.This guarantee isn't universal,
 however. A static constructor may call a function i
n another translation unit. The called function can't 
assume that the objects declared in this header have bee
n constructed, given the uncertain order in which translation 
units participate in static construction. To use these
objects in such @@@a context,
 you must first construct an object of class ios_base::Init.
