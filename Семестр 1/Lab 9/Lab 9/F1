Section 10 of RFC 4364, BGP/MPLS IP Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), describes
three potential methods for service providers to interconnect their IP-VPN (Internet
Protocol â€” Virtual Private Network) backbones in order to provide an end-to-end
MPLS-VPN where one or more sites of the VPN are connected to different service
provider autonomous systems. The purpose of this chapter is to describe the
configuration and troubleshooting for inter-AS VPN model C.
In this architecture, VPN prefixes are neither held, nor re-advertised by the
Autonomous System Border Router Provider Edge (ASBR-PE) routers, which
makes Model C more scalable than Model B (where the only prefixes exchanged
between ASs are VPN-IPv4). In Model C, the only MPLS data plane resources
consumed in the ASBRs are for infrastructure addresses of PEs and RRs rather than
VPN prefixes.
In this example, an export policy is configured to ensure that the nodes advertise
their system IP addresses (IPv4 /32 addresses) in labeled BGP to all their BGP peers
within the AS. Therefore, the ASBR-PE maintains labeled IPv4 /32 BGP routes to
other PE routers within its own AS. These BGP routes are inactive, because for each
destination within the AS, an IGP route exists which is preferred to BGP routes. The
ASBR redistributes these inactive /32 IPv4 prefixes in external Border Gateway
Protocol (eBGP) to the ASBR-PE in other service providers ASs, because the
parameter advertise-inactive is configured in eBGP. No export policy is required in eBGP.
At the same time, the ASBR programs a label switch for the received and advertised
BGP labels. The receiving ASBR advertises the received IP system prefixes to its
iBGP peers (in this case, a Route Reflector (RR)) within their AS, and eventually, all
PEs in the AS learn the system IP prefixes of the peer AS. However, there is no need
to learn the system IP address of the ASBRs in peer ASs, because they do not
exchange customer VPN prefixes.
