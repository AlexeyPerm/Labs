Declares objects that control reading 
from and writing
to the standard streams. This include is often the 
only header you need
 to do input and 
output from a C++ p
rogram.
Syntax
Once you do certain operations o
n a stream, such as
 the stan
dard input, 
you can't do operat
ions of a different orien
tation on the same
 stream. Therefore, 
a program can't operate interchangeably on bot
h cin and wcin, for example.
All the objects dec
lared in this header 
share a peculiar proper
ty â€” you can assume the
y're constructed before 
any static object
s you define, in a translati
on unit that includes <i
ostream>. 
Equally, you can
 assume that these objects are
n't destroyed before the
 destructors 
for any such static objects you define. (The ou
tput streams are, however, flus
hed during program termination.) Therefore, you c
an safely read from or write to 
the s
tandard streams before program startup and afte
r program termination.
This guarantee isn't universal,
 however. A sta
tic constructor may call a function i
n another translation unit. The called functi
on can't assume that the objects declared in
 this header have bee
n constructed, given the uncertain order in whi
ch translation units participate in static c
onstruction. To use these objects 
in such a context, you must first constr
uct an object of class ios_base::Init.
